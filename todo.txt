no cstdlib unit / compilation tests
switch expected and actual parameters everywhere, ugh
optional checksums
hooks keyed purely on function being replaced, hide the thunk target
clean api for pure hooks, separate from cpputest plugin
./b downloads and unpacks ninja binaries
metrics on crc failures, bad frames (too long before cobs 0)
send_ptr_release() errors if the send pointer isn't owned by the user? new error enum?
more descriptive return values for send_ptr_get and send_ptr_release (you already have ptr, there's nothing to send, etc)
