unsigned everywhere, none of this stuff is ever legit negative
optional checksums
hooks keyed purely on function being replaced, hide the thunk target
clean api for pure hooks, separate from cpputest plugin
metrics on crc failures, bad frames (too long before cobs 0)
send_ptr_release() errors if the send pointer isn't owned by the user? new error enum?
more descriptive return values for send_ptr_get and send_ptr_release (you already have ptr, there's nothing to send, etc)
big bit vector to hold 'ready' message state of entire send window? rtx == 0 => msg bit set?
hide __builtin_ctz() behind ARQ_COUNT_TRAILING_ZEROES()
only allow power-of-two-sized windows, replace div/mod
pull out mock functions into common header
